**Abstract**

The main contribution of this master thesis work is the description,
verification, and demonstration of the realisability in the Jolie language of
Control-Flow and Resources Workflow Patterns --- defined by the Workflow
Patterns Initiative (WPI).

The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first chapter presents a general
description of the programming paradigm behind the Jolie language,
Service-Oriented Computing, and its main context of application, Business
Process Automation (BPA). The presentation is mainly focussed on the principles
of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) and ultimately describes the main
methods concerning service composition --- orchestration and choreography. The
last section of the chapter considers SOC in a strictly industrial perspective,
highlighting its strategic features.

The second chapter focuses on the description of Jolie. This chapter is not
intended as a comprehensive description of the features in the language but
rather gives an overview of the theoretical concepts, data structures,
operators, and constructs of Jolie, used to demonstrate the realisability of
the considered Workflow Patterns.

The third chapter contains the actual realisation of the considered Workflow
Patterns in Jolie. Each pattern is first reported and explained in
terms of Coloured Petri Nets, realised as a Jolie program (or
architecture of programs), reporting the rationale behind the realisation. 

The fourth chapter summarises the results from this thesis work, showing a
comparison between Jolie and other BPA languages, as reported by WPI. The
chapter also contains a discussion on future work: the completion of this study
with an analysis on the remaining patterns from the WPI and their impact on the
evolution of the Jolie language.
