**Abstract**

Serverless computing is a Cloud development paradigm where developers write and compose stateless functions, abstracting from their deployment and scaling. In this paper, we address the problem of function-execution scheduling, i.e., how to schedule the execution of Serverless functions to optimise their performance against some user-defined goals. We introduce a declarative language of Allocation Priority Policies (APP) to specify policies that inform the scheduling of function execution. We present a prototypical implementation of APP as an extension of Apache OpenWhisk and we validate it by i) implementing a use case combining IoT, Edge, and Cloud Computing and ii) by comparing its performance to an alternative implementation that uses vanilla OpenWhisk.
