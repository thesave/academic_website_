**Abstract**

In Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), services are composed by
coordinating their communications into a flow of interactions. Coloured
Petri nets (CPN) offer a formal yet easy tool for modelling interactions
in SOAs, however mapping abstract SOAs into executable ones requires a
non-trivial and time-costly analysis. Here, we propose a methodology
that maps CPN-modelled SOAs into Jolie SOAs (our tar- get language),
exploiting a collection of recurring control-flow patterns, called
Workflow Patterns, as composable blocks of the translation. We validate
our approach with a realistic use case. In addition, we pragmatically
asses the expressiveness of Jolie wrt the considered WPs.
