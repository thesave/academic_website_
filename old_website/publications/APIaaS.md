**Abstract**

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a standard feature of any
application that exposes its functionalities to external invokers. APIs
can be composed thus obtaining new programs with new functionalities.
However API composition easily becomes a frustrating and time-costly
task that hinders API reuse. The issue derives from technology-dependent
features of API composition such as the need of extensive documentation,
protocol integration, security issues, etc.. In this paper we introduce
the perspective of the API-as-a-Service (APIaaS) layer as tool to ease
the development and deployment of applications based on API composition,
abstracting communication protocols and message formats. We elicit the
desirable features of such a layer and provide a proof-of-concept
prototype implemented using a service-oriented language.
