**Abstract**

The microservice architecture is a style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state-of-the-art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first, and microservices later. Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey addresses mostly newcomers to the discipline and offers an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, practical aspects are investigated and solutions proposed.
