**Abstract**

Ephemeral data handling, whereby processed data do not persist, is an emerging requirement of connected IT systems, due to storage constraints (IoT) or regulatory demands (eHealth, GDPR). We present ongoing work on TQuery, a query language for ephemeral data handling in microservices.
