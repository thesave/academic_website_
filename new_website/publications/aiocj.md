**Abstract**

We present AIOCJ, a framework for programming distributed adaptive
applications. Applications are programmed using AIOC, a choreographic
language suited for expressing patterns of interaction from a global
point of view. AIOC allows the programmer to specify which parts of the
application can be adapted. Adaptation takes place at runtime by means
of rules, which can change during the execution to tackle possibly
unforeseen adaptation needs. AIOCJ relies on a solid theory that ensures
applications to be deadlock-free by construction also after adaptation.
We describe the architecture of AIOCJ, the design of the AIOC language,
and an empirical validation of the framework.
