**Abstract**

Mobility as a Service takes the concept of XaaS to transportation: a MaaS
provider shall merge transport options from different mobility providers,
seamlessly handling the whole experience of travelling, from providing
information, to travel planning, and payments handling.
To effectively support the creation of a market of MaaS providers, we envision
the creation of ICT infrastructures based on microservices, a modern and
renowned development model that fosters the creation of an ecosystem of
reusable components.
The flexibility of such platforms is their key advantage, yet it poses many
security issues.
In this paper, we look at these problems through the lens of our experience on
one of such platforms, called SMAll. We classify the most relevant
vulnerabilities related to data reliability, integrity, and authenticity, and
we investigate directions for their mitigation.
