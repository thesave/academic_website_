I am an assistant professor ([RTDa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_ranks#Italy)) at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://disi.unibo.it), Universit√† di Bologna, member of the [Focus team, INRIA](http://focus.cs.unibo.it), and former member of the [Concurrency and Logic](https://concurrency.sdu.dk), the [DISI Jolie Lab](http://cs.unibo.it/projects/jolie), and the [SPACES](http://cs.unibo.it/projects/spaces/) research groups.

I obtained my PhD in 2016 with the thesis [Real-World Choreographies](http://cs.unibo.it/~sgiallor/publications/phdthesis/), on how to implement correct real-world distributed systems through the [choreographic programming](http://www.fabriziomontesi.com/files/choreographic_programming.pdf) paradigm.
I was supervised by [Maurizio Gabbrielli](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~gabbri/) and [Fabrizio Montesi](http://www.fabriziomontesi.com).


My current research interests regard Programming Languages, Process Calculi, Choreographic Programming, Microservices, Session Types, and Dynamic Adaptability.

Some fields I am also interested in are (randomly ordered):

I also love boardgames, cooking, reading (books and comics), and playing piano and the drum.
