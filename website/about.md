I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://imada.sdu.dk), University of Southern Denmark, member of the [Concurrency and Logic](https://concurrency.sdu.dk) research group, external collaborator of the INRIA [Focus](http://focus.cs.unibo.it) research group, and former member of the [DISI Jolie Lab](http://cs.unibo.it/projects/jolie) and [SPACES](http://cs.unibo.it/projects/spaces/) teams.

I obtained my PhD in 2016 with the thesis [Real-World Choreographies](http://cs.unibo.it/~sgiallor/publications/phdthesis/), on how to implement correct real-world distributed systems through the [choreographic programming](http://www.fabriziomontesi.com/files/choreographic_programming.pdf) paradigm.
I was supervised by [Maurizio Gabbrielli](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~gabbri/) and [Fabrizio Montesi](http://www.fabriziomontesi.com).


My current research interests regard Programming Languages, Process Calculi, Choreographic Programming, Microservices, Session Types, and Dynamic Adaptability.

Some fields I am also interested in are (randomly ordered):

			<li>wireless networks;</li>
			<li>functional programming;</li>
			<li>any-sort-of life-hacking and DIY projects.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

I also love boardgames, cooking, reading (books and comics), and playing piano and the drum.
