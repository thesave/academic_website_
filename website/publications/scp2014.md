**Abstract**

We illustrate our approach to develop and verify distributed, adaptive
software systems. The cornerstone of our framework is the use of
choreography languages, which allow us to obtain correctness by
construction. Workflow Patterns are also used as abstract tools to
design real systems, while techniques based on abstract interpretation
and on dynamic verification are integrated in our framework to reduce
the complexity of verification.
